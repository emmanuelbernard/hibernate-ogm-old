Association support TODO

+ Use AtomicMap instead of a raw map for
AtomicMap<RowKey,Map<String,Object>>

+ Encapsulate AtomicMap get / put into GridDialect contracts (like it's done for entities)
 => PropertyMetadataProvider
  getCollectionMetadata() (new) and flushToCache() (put)
  OgmCollectionPersister read (getSize, deleteRow)

+ optimize PropertyMetadataProvider.findByMatchingTuple
The algorithm, finds by value and infer the key from it. It is possible that we can compute the key without
nagivating the map of <RowKey,Map<String,Object>>
